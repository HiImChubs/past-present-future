  <img  class="left" src="img/pool.jpg" alt="Swimming at the pool">

  <p>In my past I was raised in a white house in Simpsonville SC with my sister. I was born in
  <a href="http://www.stfrancisbaby.org/directions.php">Saint Francis Hospital</a> on April 2nd 2001. I was raised in this white house but moved to Greenville when I was 5 and put in a new school. I've grown up in Greenville and enjoy a lot about Greenville, except woodruff road. When I was younger my favorite thing to do was to go swim at the pool with my family in our new neighborhood (shown below)</p>

    <h2>My Present</h2>
  <img class="right" src="img/collage.jpg" alt "Brandon and Jaden"
    <p>In my present things are pretty great. I have a couple friends that I am very close to and we hang out regularly. School is going good I have decent grades and can't wait to go to college. I want to major in computer science with a specialty in cyber security. My mom works for <a href="http://www.fluor.com/">Fluor</a> and is who got me interested in the whole computer science thing. I also have a job at Bi-Lo that I have a love, hate relationship with.</p>

    <p>I also play an unhealthy amount of video games with Brandon, and Jaden. We used to play every night. but now that I have my job my free time is very limited, but the freetime I do have I spend laying around with my dogs that is not already occupied by homework. I hate having a job but I dont have the money that comes at the end of the week. It's a little hard to juggle everything in a day when i'm in school and also working about 30 hours a week.</p>

    <h2>My Future</h2>
      <p>My future plans for after high school are to hopefully get accepted and go to
      <a href="http://www.sc.edu/">USC</a> for computer science. I picked usc because i've heard that the computer science program at usc is pretty good because the CEO of fluor is an alumni from USC and put a large amount of money into the computer science field. After college hopefully i can find a well paying job somewhere in greenville for cyber security or move somewhere where it's warm cause I hate cold weather with a passion. Hopefully all that works out in the future.</p>
