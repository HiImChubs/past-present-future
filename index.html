  <h1>My Past, Present, and Future</h1>
  <h2>Past</h2>
  <p>In my past I was raised in a white house in Simpsonville SC with my sister. I was born in <a href="http://www.stfrancisbaby.org/directions.php">Saint Francis Hospital</a> on April 2nd 2001. I was raised in this white house but moved to Greenville when I was 5 and put in a new school. I've grown up in Greenville and enjoy a lot about Greenville, exept woodruff road. When I was younger my favorite thing to do was to go swim at the pool with my family in our new neighboorhood (shown below)</p>
